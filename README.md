This repo is a hub for my UE5 C++ projects:

- Obstacle Assault – [Repo link](https://github.com/acosta3/ObstacleAssault)
- Dungeon Escape – [Repo link](https://github.com/acosta3/DungeonEscape)

## What I Learned Building These Unreal Engine 5 Projects Using C++

Across these projects, I implemented core gameplay systems in Unreal Engine 5 (C++ and Blueprints), including:

- Moving and rotating platforms  
- Trigger volumes and pressure plates  
- Collectable items  
- Projectiles and line trace bullets  
- Health and damage systems  
- Level management  
- Third-person movement and animations  
- Enemy AI using behavior trees  

These mechanics were built across multiple small games in this portfolio.
